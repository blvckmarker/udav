Add primary support for if-else statement. It's primary, because there no if-else expression like in F#.
Now, Udav supports some typical things like:
```
let a = 123
{
    if (a > 10)
        a = 0
    else if (a < 100){
        a = a * a
        if (a > 20)
            a = 0 // there're no point in values
        else
            a = -1
    }
    else
        a = -a
}
```
# Plans:
1) Complete multiline syntax analyze, because at the current moment we can't do this thing:
    ```
    {
        let a = 0
        if (){}
    }
    ```
    Compiler reads let statement and ends with it
2) Add if-else expression
