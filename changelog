Add primary support for if-else statement. It's primary, because there no if-else expression like in F#.
Now, Udav supports some typical things like:
```
let a = 123
{
    if (a > 10)
        a = 0
    else if (a < 100){
        a = a * a
        if (a > 20)
            a = 0 // there're no point in values
        else
            a = -1
    }
    else
        a = -a
}
```
# Plans:
1) Add if-else expression

Now for-while statements are available. Fixed an error related to the scope of variables(before it searched for local scope, now it search in all scope-tree)
```it isn't JS, lol
let acc = 1
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i = i + 1)
    acc = acc * i
```

# Plans:
1) Add if-else expression
2) Add increment and decrement operations, shorted binary operations (+=, ~=, *=, etc)
3) Fix the problem related with for-statement scope. In example, 'i' variable placed in global scope, but should be placed in local for-statement scope.
